# CodeQuiz
Build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions.

## About the project
Using javascript to manipulate the DOM, I have designed and built a coding quiz with 8 multiple choice questions. When a user clicks play, a timer starts and they are presented with a question. When answered correctly, text appears to tell them the answer is correct and 10 points are added to the score. When answered incorrectly, text appears and 10 seconds is deducted from the timer. When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0 the game is over.
At the end of quiz, a user can input their initials to save their highscore to local storage. They can also click the highscore link to view a leaderboard of results.
